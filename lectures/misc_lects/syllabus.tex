\subsubsection*{Teaching Assistant: TBD} 
Office hours: TBD, \\
e-mail: TBD

\subsection*{Class Meetings} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays 1:30 -- 2:20 PM at NH W183
    \item If in-person classes are canceled due to inclement weather, you will be notified of the instructional continuity plan for this class via Canvas
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Pre-Requisite} 
\begin{itemize}
	\item ECEN 304 (Signals and Systems) or permission of the instructor
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ECEN 463/863 Course Description} 
The successful student will exhibit competence in a wide variety of topics pertaining to
Digital Signal Processing (DSP), including:
\begin{itemize}

    \item Sampling of continuous signals
    \item Discrete transform theory (including Z-transform, Discrete Time Fourier Transform, and Discrete Fourier Transform)
    \item Digital filter use and design via matlab software
    \item Time/Frequency, polyphase and other representations of discrete-time signals
    \item Signal processing implementation and simulation in Matlab
\end{itemize}


% \subsection*{Tentative schedule and class topics}

% \input{tentative_schedule.tex}

% \footnotetext[1]{Reading assignments in ``Discrete-time signal processing'', Oppenheim and Schafer, 3rd edition}.

% \subsection*{Resources}

% \subsubsection*{Textbook}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item ``Discrete-time signal processing'', Oppenheim and Schafer, 3rd edition, 2010.
% 	\item Lecture notes will cover all the material, but further reading of the textbook is encouraged.
% \end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Class website}

The class website \href{https://canvas.unl.edu}{https://canvas.unl.edu} contains

\begin{itemize}
	\item Lecture notes, homework assignments, and Matlab code.
	\item Homework submission will be online on Canvas.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Evaluation Basis}
Homework: $40\%$ - $70\%$ \\
Exams: $30\%$ - $60\%$ (Depending on 1 or 2 Exams) 

\subsection*{Homework policy}

% There will be 6 homework assignments.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most problem sets will be assigned on Friday and will be due the following Friday by 11:59 PM.
	\item Assignments should be submitted online on Canvas. Submit a single .pdf file with your solutions. 
	\item Homework solutions will typically be available shortly after the homework due date. Homework grades will typically be available within a week of the due date.
	\item Discussion among students is encouraged, but individual solutions must be submitted
	\item In general, late homeworks will not be accepted. Under extenuating circumstances, extensions must be approved by the instructor or TA, and arranged prior to the deadline.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{MATALB Exercises}

Computer exercises will be given on a regular basis (including Dead Week). These
computer simulations provide extremely valuable learning opportunities. You will be
required to program these assignments yourselves.

\subsection*{In-Class Quizzes}
Periodic quizzes may be given. Usually we will use these to encourage student participation
in assigned reading. This will allow us to cover course material more thoroughly and
efficiently.

\subsection*{Exams}
One or two exams will be given during the semester. Make-up exams will be oral.

\subsection*{Personal Responsibility}
Class attendance and participation is strongly encouraged. Late materials are not accepted unless previously approved.

\subsection*{Academic Integrity}
As is always the case, you will be responsible for your own work in this class.
Misrepresenting someone else's work as your own (that is, without clear attribution of
source) is considered cheating. Cheating will result in a course grade of F.


\subsection*{Students with Disabilities}
The Office of Civil Rights requires the following ADA language to be included in all
syllabi (as per Dr. Horn, UNL ADA Compliance Officer, 2007): \\

"Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential
discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation. It is the policy of the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln to provide flexible and individualized accommodation to
students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in
course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services,
students must be registered with the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office,
132 Canfield Administration, 472-3787 voice or TTY."









% \subsection*{Exams policy}
% \subsubsection*{Midterm}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item In-class midterm on July 23. 
% 	\item Midterm covers lectures 1 to 7 (homeworks 1 to 3).
% 	\item Midterm is open book and open notes.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsubsection*{Final}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item The final exam will be a 24-hour-take-home exam. Dates TBD.
% 	\item The final exam should take just a few hours, and it will involve implementation and simulation of some digital signal processing algorithms.
% 	\item The review session for the final will be on the last lecture.
% \end{itemize}
